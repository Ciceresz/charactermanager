# Grendel - a Dungeons and Dragons Player's Companion #
Simple web-based UI for managing a character for the Dungeons and Dragons game. Designed to be usable and useful on a 320x480 iPhone/smartphone screen. Much inspiration taken from Redblade character manager and the Timpani excel sheet.

Data is based on the 3.5 Players Handbook.

**[Demo site](http://charmgr.stepnext.net)** (code changes quickly, so the zip releases are out of date).

## v0.6 ##
0.5 isn't done (since I can't get it to load on my friends' iPhone), but 0.6 will be focused on "rational" UI reconfiguration based on the browser viewport, eg. for an iPad (768x1024):

This incidentally makes for a nice printable sheet, for those without a large format portable electronic device.

I'd like to do this for all the screen sizes thing is likely to see:
1024x768
480x320
800x600
600x800
